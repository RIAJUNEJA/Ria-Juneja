Hi! I am Ria Juneja. I am a sophomore at University of California San Diego. I am majoring in **Math-Computer Science** and minoring in **Data Science**. I am interested in 
- machine learning, 
- artificial intelligence, 
- data analytics, 
- fintech, 
- cryptography and network security, 
- algorithms and data structures,  
- data visualization and communication

In my grade 12 board examinations in the non-medical stream, I secured **first position in Chandigarh** and third position in the Tricity, which has fueled my interest in pursuing a career in **STEM** fields.
